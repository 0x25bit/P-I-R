# P. I. R.

* **All credit is due to killeven, he created this whole repo, I'm just trying to add something to it**

* **Supports WinXP-Win10(x86 and x64 platforms**)
* **Shellcode generation and FWB+**
* **Single thread and single port (Inspired from Bifrost Rat)**
* ** Added support for WOW64. Due to UAC issues, several functions might not work. For example, ActiveX is enabled. Due to the change of Loader, there is no time to change the client-side generation function.**
* ** The current shellcode structure is similar to 2.32, it will be injected into explorer.exe first, then into the chosen target process, this is to ensure process is protected**
* ** Please use FASM, Delphi, Visual Studio 2013 to compile / Will be updating for VS2019**
