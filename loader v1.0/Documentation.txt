Loader functionality
	Connection method:
		Direct Connection
		SOCKS5 connection (optional)

	Persistence:
		HKLM/HKCU Run key
		ActiveX (optional/requires admin priv)

	Self-copy:
		System dir
		Windows dir
		Self-delete / Melt

	Injection (optional, requires WOW64 related code) (need to include 32-bit and 64-bit code) (when injection is disabled, only 32bit code is needed, loader_main executes directly)
		Guardian (optional)
		Inject into a specific process (enumerates thru 4 chosen processes with an interval of 7 seconds. PE will be injected into explorer.exe by default and then injected into the selected target process, or if that fails starts browser and injects into it)
		Inject into the default browser
		
	WOW64 functions:
		wow64_call
		wow64_inject_memory
		wow64_create_remote_thread
	
Loader -> Inject into explorer.exe (x86, x64) -> Inject into browser or specific process (x86)

All extra functions have been expanded to int64
